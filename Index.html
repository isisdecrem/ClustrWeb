                  We believe that through connecting students to their clubs,
                  engagement within clubs will skyrocket. We value student's  
                  connecting to their school environment and engaging in clubs. 
                  Through engagement in clubs, students will be able to discover
                  what they are passionate about, make friends, and feel like a 
                  larger part of their community. Every student deserves to be able 
                  to find a community within their school that they love. School clubs 
                  have the ability to do so much for students and limited accessibility to clubs
                  should not be what prevents students from joining. The current
                  system schools use to familiarize students and clubs is broken: many schools
                  rely on just one club fair a year to get students to sign up for clubs.
                  Schools who do offer students comprehensive lists of clubs often do so 
                  with a PDF document hidden on their website. The clubs at schools also have no 
                  standard way of communicating with their members. Some clubs use Instagram,
                  others use email lists, some have Facebook groups. Students need
                  ONE place to browse their schools clubs. Clustr is that place.

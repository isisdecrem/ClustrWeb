                <p> Clustr was born out of (1) my teamates and I noticing an issue 
                    at our school, but also (2) me wanting to do some sort of coding project.
                    I've taken lots of CS classes and built little things here 
                    and there, but I really wanted to start on a larger project.
                     I've grown up watching 
                    my dad work on start ups and have always had an itch to
                    do the same. 
                </p>
                <h4 class = "questions-isis">Academic interests</h4>
                <p>  I could read my biology textbook for hours,
                    but I also love studying computer science and 
                    am interested in learning about mass incarceration
                    in the US.

                <p> When my teammates and I realized the issue of club organization at my school, we decided to create an app to help with these problems. I had been interested in applying my programming knowledge in a project that would help benefit our community, and Clustr was a great way for me to do that.

                <h4 class = "questions-an">Academic interests</h4>
                <p>  I’m a member of my schools robotics team and I am interested in computer science and engineering.

                <h4 class = "questions-an">Future goals</h4>
                <p>  In the future, I plan to major in computer science at college. I will also continue to work at Clustr to help create new features to improve our products!
                </p>
                <h4 class = "questions-an">What do you do at Clustr?</h4>
                <p>  At Clustr, I spend most of my time programming and working on developing the app. I worked on many of the functions and on the backend while integrating with Firebase. I am currently figuring out how to develop a web app for Clustr in order to allow our app to be more accessible to all users.

                <h4 class = "questions-caleb">Why Clustr?</h4>
                <p> As an officer in 3 clubs, I found it extremely difficult to keep members on the same page. Not only would each of those clubs use different platforms for management, but would also have multiple means of communication within to cater to all members as some would lack a Facebook account, while others would only use services such as Discord. Seeing this, I joined Clustr to help build a better interface and managerial tool for club officers, but also to cater to members by means of making more accessible the ability to find clubs to join and to receive updates and event details in a friendly manner.

                <h4 class = "questions-caleb">What do you do at Clustr?</h4>
                <p>  I spend a lot of time building business outreach plans and operation models. I seek user feedback and increase the value propostions that Clustr+ has to offer in order to ensure peak differentiation, and I also spend time finding partnerships with club leaders and schools. During the development of Clustr, I collaboratively worked on coding the backend and helped connect features to the front end of the app. I also helped design the product concept and MVPs that we used for testing.
